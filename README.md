# Gesture-Controlled-Robot

In this project, we have designed a simple Hand Gesture Controlled Robot using Arduino. This Hand Gesture Controlled Robot is based on Arduino Nano, ADXL335, RF Transmitter-Receiver Pair and L293D Motor Driver.

# Preface

A Robot is an electro-mechanical system that is operated by a computer program. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous. An autonomous robot is not controlled by human and acts on its own decision by sensing its environment.

Majority of the industrial robots are autonomous as they are required to operate at high speed and with great accuracy. But some applications require semi-autonomous or human controlled robots.

Some of the most commonly used control systems are voice recognition, tactile or touch controlled and motion controlled.
